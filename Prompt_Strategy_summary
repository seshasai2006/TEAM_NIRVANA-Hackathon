The first prompt sets the foundation by locking in what the project is, which technologies you’re using, and how everything fits together. 
The second focuses on building trust and credibility, which really matters for a healthcare platform. 
The third makes it clear who the users are and what they’re allowed to do, so things don’t get messy later. 
The fourth defines the patient and donor data properly, because if the data is wrong or unclear, everything else falls apart. 
The fifth turns that data into dashboards, which helps you see whether the system actually makes sense from a user’s point of view. 
The sixth brings the platform to life by turning ideas into real APIs and database logic. 
The seventh is where the real value happens by adding genuine AI-based matching, not just “AI” in name. 
The eighth makes sure medical data is handled responsibly with proper security. 
The ninth gives you control through an admin layer so the system can be managed in the real world.
The last prompt ties everything together with notifications and gets the project ready for deployment.
